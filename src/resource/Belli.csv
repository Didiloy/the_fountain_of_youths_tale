Belli000::CREW: Cough cough … Boss I don’t have a good feeling about this planet.\n There’s fog all over the place, this might be a poisonous planet. \n I feel sick and wanna throw up. But we never know what we can find here… \n
Belli001::Chief, I’m proud of you. After my examination, I found out that this planet was about to get destroyed.\n It was basically in decomposition and it would have been suicidal to stay there.\n
Belli002::CREW: Hey what’s that? There is something under the ground, want to look at it? Really, captain, I don’t feel it, I’m nauseous.\n
Belli021::CREW: Hey it’s an orb! So pretty!! \n -I wonder if it has magical prorpriety. I don’t think so… But we don’t quite know what it is... \n
Belli022::Ahhhhh I’m paralyzed… This was dangerous to take. You died... \n
