Belli000::CREW: Cough cough … Boss I don’t have a good feeling about this planet.\nThere’s fog all over the place, this might be a poisonous planet.\nI feel sick and wanna throw up. But we never know what we can find here… Should We "GO" away or "LOOK" more into this planet?\n
Belli001::Chief, I’m proud of you. After my examination, I found out that this planet was about to get destroyed.\nIt was basically in decomposition and it would have been suicidal to stay there.\n
Belli002::CREW: Hey what’s that? There is something under the ground, want to look at it? Really, captain, I don’t feel it, I’m nauseous. Are you sure you do not want to "GO" away, but if not we can alway "USE" this pickaxe to find something more.\n
Belli021::CREW: Hey it’s an orb! So pretty!! \n-I wonder if it has magical prorpriety. I don’t think so… But we don’t quite know what it is... DO you want to "TAKE" it with us or "GO" and leave it?\n
Belli022::Ahhhhh I’m paralyzed… This was dangerous to take. You died...\n
