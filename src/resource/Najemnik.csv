N000::CREW: As we go from planet to planet it is getting weirder and weirder… This look like a gigantic battlefield. Where the heck did we end up in? Hey, what is that black thing over the horizon?\nProtagonist : You might not be very wrong in talking about a battlefield. This seems to be an army.\nMhh I wonder if we should "USE" our weapons to fight or "Go" and flee?\n
N001::CREW: Woah this army is indeed huge… I think if we would have fought them, I might be dead right now.\nHey, something is flying right before us, looks like it’s about to attack, but it seems that they are protecting their base. Should we "USE" our weapons to engage in the fight or "GO" and flee again?\n
N002::CREW: Hey that wasn’t an easy battle but we won it! We fought as lions. I think we have in our hand the chief this army. What do you want to do with him boss? SHOULD we "ATTACk" and kill him or let him "GO" ?\n
N011::Ohhh no, they’re after us… You died in attempting to flee a spacecraft battle.\n
N012::Yeahhh boss! We did it, we took their base! Hey see over there! It’s their chief! Let’s kill him but he’s way fast. It’ll be hard to catch him.\nShould we "ATTACK" and kill him or let him "Go"?\n
N021::Army: Thank you for delivering us from the hand of this tyrant, my name is Napoleon and I am the captain of this 40.000 man’s army. We are subject to you now.\n
N022::CREW: Huh boss, I think this chief is coming back with the army that we’ve seen before. Should we still "ATTACK" and fight back or "GO" and escape?\n
N111::CREW: Huh boss, I think this chief is coming back with the army that we’ve seen before. We’re trapped in here…\nNo, we’ve lost the ¾ of our man. That was definitely a bad call…\nShould we still "ATTACK" and fight back or "GO" and escape?\n
