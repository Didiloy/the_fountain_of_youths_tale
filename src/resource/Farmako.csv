My master has been waiting for you. Would you please follow me?\n -Crew Member: Boss, should we "GO" and follow him or should we "LOOK" more for clues if he can be trusted?\n
F001::Crew Member: Whoa this place looks so lit! I wanna visit it. There seems to be a ton of medicine around here. What do you think boss? Should we visit the city?\n  
F002::Dr Who: What the heck are you guys doing? Why do you check me out? You’ll learn strangers that on this planet. Trust and respect are the foundation of a good attitude. I shall depart because you have offended me.\n CREW : Boss, we probably messed up here, what can we do?\n Should we "GO" and visit the city by ourselves or run after Who and "USE" our knife to steal him?\n
F010::DR WHO: Hello Master, thank you for waiting patiently. Here are the people that you’ve been looking for.\n Master: Hello, my name is DR Pasteur, I have heard so much about you and your crew. You see it has been quite a long time since I wanted to meet you. Well before going more in-depth, I see that you are very weary. Would it please you to go to this room to rest?\ "Yes" or "No"?\n
F011::Crew: Hey that’s way cool, there are heaps of medicine here, let’s buy some so that we can heal our friends. Do we have money?\n Marchand: Hey!

F222::DR WHO: What have I already told you? You cannot learn and people that cannot learn are not meant to live on this planet. Knowledge is power. You leave me no choice but to kill you.\n You have been killed by Dr. Who.\n
F111::Pasteur: Well, it’s okay… I understand that you do not trust me yet. However, I wanted to ask you if I could join your crew. I have always desired to travel through space and discover new planets. I am a doctor and would be very needed to help your crew’s health.\n
