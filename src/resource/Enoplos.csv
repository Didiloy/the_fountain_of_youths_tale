story::You have finally arrived in Enoplos, THE planet where you can find enough to arm a whole ship. It would be nice to "GO" to a bar to get some information, we can also "LOOK" by ourselves
ce_0::"I see a bar called the "drunken clamr" across the street, let's go there", says McGryver.\nWhat an atmosphere in this bar! It's really a happy mess.\n"Look, that guy over there is telling a story about the fountain of youth, we should listen to him," says McGryver.\nYou'll listen to him but it's already the end of the story, you just have time to hear him talk about a certain Rambaw who would have the map on him.\nYou can "LOOK" for Rambaw or you can "GO" away from this planet
ce_0_0::You soon learn that Rambaw is actually the second in command of a big smuggler who can provide weapons. In exchange for a little money you get the information about Rambaw's position.\nYou go to him and explain why you need the map. He is willing to give it to you, but only on the condition that you take him on your crew, because finding the fountain is his greatest dream. Do you take him with you "YES" or "NO"t?
ce_0_0_0::You have now in your crew someone able to provide you with weapons and you have also found the map supposed to lead to the fountain
ce_0_0_1::Rambaw looks suspicious to you so you prefer to refuse.\nYou will find another way to get the card.\nSo you leave the planet
ce_0_1::You think that this track will not lead to anything and you leave this planet. You still have no weapons but you will find them somewhere else.
ce_1::You are looking for smugglers who could arm your ship but as nobody knows you nobody wants to sell you anything for fear that you are an undercover cop. You have to leave the planet empty-handed
