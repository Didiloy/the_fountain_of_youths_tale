story::You and your little crew arrive around a small rocky planet.\n"Great finally a planet, I wonder which one it is" says McGryver.\n"We really need to find a navigator," you think as you set course for the planet.\nOnce landed you call a passer-by:\n- Hello, what planet are we on ?\n- We are on Astronomiya, this whole planet is a school training the best astronomers of the galaxy!\n- Oh how convenient! Let's go into the university.\nYou're looking for the university, you could ask for directions... do you want to keep looking by yourself?
ca_0::You spend hours searching but you can't find it, finally you decide to go on your way, you'll find someone who knows how to drive a ship on another planet right?
ca_1::It's an unknown planet, maybe it's better to ask the people who live there for directions.\nSo you call a local and ask him your way.\n- The university? You were right to ask me, you would never have found it by yourself, it's a huge underground structure whose entrance is protected by badge. Follow me, I was just going there.\nArrived at the university you notice that he didn't lie to you and that the building is really huge, you can't see the end of it! You thank him and let him go to his class.\nDo you want to propose him to join you as a navigator before he leaves?
ca_1_0::So you offer to join you.\n- Oh, that's a nice offer, but I still have a lot to learn here at the university, so I have to decline.\nThat's a pity, let's keep looking
ca_1_1::"Well he is now gone and we are were we wanted to be" you say, "let's look for a navigator"
story_2::You've been walking around the building for about an hour when McGryver yells out "I know that guy over there! I lent him money and he ran off and never paid me back".\nYou have to do something, you think of a solution while McGryver talks about kidnapping to make him pay his debt.\nDo you want to kidnap him?
ca_2::you'll talk to him so McGryver can approach from behind without being noticed.\n"Hey, excuse me, I'm looking for..." you don't have time to finish your sentence when McGryver has already taken out his tranquiligun and sent an arrow into the man's neck.\nHe collapses in your arms and you walk out of the university pretending he is drunk to get past security.\nYou then take off with your new captive navigator
ca_3::"No!" you tell McGryver, we're not going to kidnap him.\n"I'll go talk to him."\nSo you walk up to the student and go talk to him.\nThe moment he sees McGryver he apologizes: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to leave with the money", "give me a chance to make up for it", "I can work for you, I don't want to stay here anyway, life is boring, let me be your navigator!\nWhat a stroke of luck, that's exactly what you came to this planet for.\nAre you hiring him?
ca_3_0::You got a new navigator and you didn't even had to kidnap him !
ca_3_1::you left as you came, without a navigator
